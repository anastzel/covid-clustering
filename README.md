# COVID-19 Clustering

 
This project was done in 2020 as part of the course Introduction to Data Science, while being an Erasmus+ Exchange student in AGH, Krakow, Poland.
  
### Description

The goal of this project is to perform clustering analysis in a time series dataset regarding the COVID-19 infections.
 
### Dataset

The official dataset of the [COVID-19 infections](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv) from [CSSEGISandData](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData) is used.

For the purpose of time saving, only a subtotal of the whole Dataset is going to be used, for demonstation. Keep in mind that in order to train with the whole dataset, it is going to take a lot of time.
